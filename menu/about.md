**Hi!**

I graduated as Electrical Engineer a few years ago, and since then I've been passionate about the [Embedded Systems][es] field. Currently I'm focused on the area of firmware development [design patterns][dp]. My interests include [bare-metal][bm] firmware as well as OS-based systems applied to sectors such as the IoT industry and digital control in Power Electronics.

My experience is centered around technical areas of electronic product development at [Nuvitron][nuvitron] and electrical design for industrial manufacturing at [Marcopolo Colombia][mp].

At work, I've been fortunate to take part in the design process of electronic and electrical products from idea to production, stepping through CAD models, prototyping, supply chain assessment and first batch production. It's my intention to reflect some of that learning process through this blog.

A complementary area that I started to tackle recently is web development and the front-end technologies. This website makes part of this effort.

## Highlights

- **Hardware design:** Product sketching, planning and functional specs. Principles of [DFM][dfm] (Design For Manufacturing), some [IPC][ipc] standards for electronics design, functional test setups and technical product documentation. Use of Open Source [EDA][eda] tools like *[KiCAD][kicad]* and *[LTSpice][ltspice]* for design and simulation.

- **Fast prototyping:** Components sourcing, [SMT][smt] soldering (0402, QFN, etc.) and fast iteration cycles. Knowledge of local and international manufacturing capabilities. Proficient in hardware testing and debugging. Agile and competent work in electronics laboratories.

- **Programming:** Hardware-specific firmware development and integration with platform-independent libraries and APIs.
